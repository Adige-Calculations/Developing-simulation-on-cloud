# npm (Node Package Manager)

Initialization of a package

```sh
npm init
```
Then to import a package on your js/ts code, you have to first install the package locally as:

```
npm install gl-matrix 
```

On the code itself, you can then call the following module as:

```js
import { mat4 } from 'gl-matrix'

...
```
