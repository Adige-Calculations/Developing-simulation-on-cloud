# Javascript

Javascript (JS) is an object oriented language. It is useful to think at JS as an interactive layer 
on top of the content, HTML and its presentation, CSS.
The most basic way to interact is to inject new HTML content into the document.

## Operator
Only the more criptic operaor are covered for bervity reason. The question mark operator follows the 
following rules:

```js
//syntax
condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
```
such as:

```js
function getFee(isMember) {
  return (isMember ? '$2.00' : '$10.00');
}

console.log(getFee(true));
// expected output: "$2.00"

console.log(getFee(false));
// expected output: "$10.00"

console.log(getFee(null));
// expected output: "$10.00"
```
While the ```void``` operator evaluates the given expression and then returns "undefined":

```js
const output = void 1;
console.log(output);
// expected output: "undefined"
```
such as:

```js
void function foo() {
  console.log("foo is executed");
}();
// expected output: foo is executed
```

## Primitives

Being JS a weakly type language the types are deduced from the text:
 
```js
// String:
let stringDemo = "A string of text.";

// Integer point numbers
let integerDemo = 4;

// Floating point numbers
let floatDemo = 5.6;

// Boolean:
let booleanDemo = true;

// Null value (nothing):
let nullDemo = null;

// Undefined:
let undefinedDemo;
let undefinedAssignedDemo = undefined;

// Object:
const objectDemo = {
  dance: "Mambo",
  number: 5,
};

// Array:
const arrayDemo = ["tango", "foxtrot", "waltz", "rumba", "bolero"];
const collection = ["piggy", integerDemo, 5, true]
```

## Variable allocation  

Each data must be stored in memory and an allocation scheme for parsing the data is presented.

### var

Varibles can be issued, keep in mind they are globally scoped i.e. if you change its value
inside a function the change will be reflected in the global code.

```js
var x = 4, y = "variable";  // mutable content - it is possible to be reassigned
```

### let
It's a ```var``` with local scope:

```js
let x = 5;
```

### const 
Works like a let but it, cannot change its state and it is valid 
in the parents section of code i.e. it does not goes out of scope 
with code sections:

```js
const x = 5;
x = 9        // Problem: Assignemnt to constant value 
``` 

## Functions
A tipical function is implemented as:

### Traditional function expressions
The traditional method to write an anonimus function is the following:

```js
function (a, b) {
	... 
	return c 
}
```

An example where you declare the name of a function can be:
```js
function someName () {
	...
}
```
### Arrow function expressions
A methode introduced with ES6 and its becoming more and more common in modern JS:

```js
const do_actions = () => { ... }  // To execute run:   do_actions(); 
(a) => {return a}
```
They are a simpler way to represent a function, but keep in mind that you cannot use the 
"this" object to call the object itself.
Furthermore the arrow function can be called only after its declaration hence forcing good code writing.

## Object
An object is instanciate in this way

```js 
const backpack = {        // object container
	name: "my backpack",  // properties
	strap_lenght: {
		left: 3,
		right: 5,
	},
	lid_open: false,
	
	toggle_lid: function(lidStatus) {  // methods (properties containing functions)
		this.lid_open(lidStatus);
	},
}
```

## Object container 
The ```const``` type association tells that you can change the properities of the value 
however not the type of it 

```js
const backpack = {        				
	name: "my backpack", 				 // you can change this property
	change_name: function(newName) {
		this.name(newName)
	}
}
```

## Scope oject

```js
// Dot notation 
backpack.name

// Bracket notation
backpack["name"]
```
The reason behind the bracket notation is to get a more readable control in more complex
case.

```js
var query = "name";
backpack[query];
```

## Classes

There are who way of declaring a class:

```js
// Class declaration
class Name { ... }

// Class expression
const Name = class { ...}

```

### Class constructor 
To create a constructor

```
class Book {
  constructor(name, page, weight) {
    this.name = name;
    this.curretn_page = page;
    this.weight = weight;
  }

  change_page (page) {
    this.curretn_page = page;  
  }
}

// Simple implementation
const book1 = new Book("wow", 200, 2);
book1.change_page(4);
```

## Callback

Sometimes we have two functions and we want to control the sequence at which they
execute. This typically happens if one function relies on the output of another 
function for data or when one function has to wait for another function to 
complete before doing something. For example:

```js 
...

const function_to_be_passed_as_callback = (a) { return a + 1 }

// Here a function is trated as a input variable, hence you are passing function object to be used later on
const add_one (a, callback) {
	callback(a)
}

const printHTML = (number) => {
  const table = document.createElement("table");
  const new_number = add_one(number, function_to_be_passed_as_callback)
  table.innerHTML = `
    <tr>
      <td>Add one to ${number}:</td>
      <td>${new_number}</td>
    </tr>
  `;
  document.querySelector("main").append(tipTable);
};

...
```

## Event reference

Events can be look at as "interesting changes" in the system. A well listed exaplnation of 
these possible events can be found at:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events

### How do you capture the event object in an event listener?

The event object is automatically passed as a parameter to the callback function. 
Simply name and use the parameter.
