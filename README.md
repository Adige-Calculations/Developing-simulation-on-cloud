# Learning Book
This repository contains a book that ports in html pages where I take notes of my learnings.

## Build the book
To build the book on you local machine, install the Rust toolchain, then install a cargo package called ```mdbook```. Follow the instruction to build the book.

``` console
cargo install mdbook
mdbook build
```
## Serve the book in local
```console
mdbook serve
```
